## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to  [explain to anyone](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/TYd0rtgWdnYZVZYW0z73pg) 
 ,  without the help of Google :
### General
* What is a hash function
* What makes a good hash function
* What is a hash table, how do they work and how to use them
* What is a collision and what are the main ways of dealing with collisions in the context of a hash table
* What are the advantages and drawbacks of using hash tables
* What are the most common use cases of hash tables
## Requirements
### General
* Allowed editors:  ` vi ` ,  ` vim ` ,  ` emacs ` 
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All your files should end with a new line
* A  ` README.md `  file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the  ` Betty `  style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/hs-hq/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) 
 and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/hs-hq/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl) 

* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* You are allowed to use the C standard library
* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called  ` hash_tables.h ` 
* Don’t forget to push your header file
* All your header files should be include guarded
## More Info
### Data Structures
Please use these data structures for this project:
```bash
/**
 * struct hash_node_s - Node of a hash table
 *
 * @key: The key, string
 * The key is unique in the HashTable
 * @value: The value corresponding to a key
 * @next: A pointer to the next node of the List
 */
typedef struct hash_node_s
{
     char *key;
     char *value;
     struct hash_node_s *next;
} hash_node_t;

/**
 * struct hash_table_s - Hash table data structure
 *
 * @size: The size of the array
 * @array: An array of size @size
 * Each cell of this array is a pointer to the first node of a linked list,
 * because we want our HashTable to use a Chaining collision handling
 */
typedef struct hash_table_s
{
     unsigned long int size;
     hash_node_t **array;
} hash_table_t;
